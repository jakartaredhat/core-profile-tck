== Installation

This chapter explains how to obtain the TCK and supporting software and provides recommendations for how to install/extract it on your system.

=== Obtaining the Software

You can obtain a release of the Jakarta Core Profile TCK project from the link:$$https://download.eclipse.org/jakartaee/platform/$$[Jakarta EE download site]. The release stream for Jakarta Profile TCK is named _10.0.x_. The Jakarta Core Profile TCK is distributed as a ZIP file, which contains the TCK artifacts (the test suite binary and source, test suite configuration file) in /artifacts and documentation in /doc.

You can also download the current source code from link:$$https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jakartaee-tck/core-profile-tck$$[GitHub repository].

Executing the TCK requires a Jakarta EE 10 or better runtime environment (i.e., application server), to which the test artifacts are deployed and the individual tests are invoked. The TCK does not depend on any particular Jakarta EE implementation.

Naturally, to execute Java programs, you must have a Java SE runtime environment. The TCK requires Java SE 11 or better, which you can obtain from the link:$$http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/index.html$$[Java Software] website.

=== The TCK Environment

The TCK requires the following two Java runtime environments:

* Java SE 11 or better

* Maven 3.6 or better

* Jakarta EE 10 or better (e.g., WildFly 27.x, GlassFish V7, OpenLiberty X)

You should refer to vendor instructions for how to install the runtime environment.

Unzipping that TCK archive will create a core-profile-tck-x.y.z root folder which contains the TCK contents. To complete the installation, cd into the artifacts directory and install the standalone TCKs and Core Profile TCK artifacts using the maven pom.xml file. From that directory run:

`mvn install`

to populate the local maven repository with the neccessary dependencies.
