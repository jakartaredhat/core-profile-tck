== Executing (Core Profile TCK)
The Jakarta Core Profile is designed to be executed in a framework like Maven where the Core Profile TCK along with each standalone TCK described as required in the <<introduction>> are configured in a profile that defined the dependencies and configuration to run the associated TCK.

== WildFly Example

In the examples directory of the TCK distribution, there is a wf-core-tck-runner maven project that illustrates running the standalone TCKs along with the Jakarta Core Profile TCK. The wf-core-tck-runner/README-WFP.adoc describes how to run these TCKs against WildFly.

The associated pom.xml Maven files in each TCK runner directory illustrate the configuration needed to run the tests using Maven and Arquillian.
